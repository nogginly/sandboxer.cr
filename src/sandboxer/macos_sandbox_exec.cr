module Sandboxer
  # macOS sandbox runner using sandbox-exec and SBPL profiles.
  #
  # sandbox-exec wraps a process in Apple's Seatbelt framework (a MACF kernel
  # module). It evaluates a declarative SBPL (Sandbox Profile Language) policy
  # against every syscall the process makes; violations return EPERM.
  #
  # SBPL is a Scheme-like DSL. This runner generates a deny-default profile
  # and adds explicit allow rules derived from the policy.
  #
  # Deprecation note: sandbox-exec has been marked deprecated in macOS headers
  # since 10.8 but remains functional through current releases. No public
  # replacement exists for the ad-hoc CLI use case (App Sandbox requires code
  # signing and an app bundle). Used in production by Chromium and Firefox.
  #
  # The BASELINE constant contains the minimum permissions any process needs
  # to start under deny-default. Omitting any of these typically causes an
  # immediate crash or silent hang (dyld, Mach IPC, and sysctl are all gated).
