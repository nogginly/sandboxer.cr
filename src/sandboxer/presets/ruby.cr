    # Pre-defined policies for common Ruby installations.
    #
    # Choose the constant that matches the Ruby installation layout, or use
    # `for_executable` to derive a policy from a known binary path (useful
    # for manager-installed rubies where the root varies at runtime).
    #
    # ## Static presets
    #
    # Each constant covers the Ruby runtime, stdlib, and the default per-user
    # gem directory. Merge the appropriate constant into your policy:
    #
    #   policy = my_policy.merge(Sandboxer::Preset::Ruby::MACOS_ARM_BREW)
    #
    # ## Builder
    #
    # For rubies installed by a version manager (ruby-install, rbenv, chruby,
    # asdf), where the install root varies at runtime, use `for_executable`:
    #
    #   policy = my_policy.merge(Sandboxer::Preset::Ruby.for_executable("/path/to/ruby"))
    #
    # The path must be the real binary, not a shim. For shim-based managers:
    #
    #   # rbenv
    #   ruby_path = `rbenv which ruby`.chomp
    #   # asdf
    #   ruby_path = `asdf which ruby`.chomp
    #
    # ## Gem paths
    #
    # All presets grant read-only access to the default GEM_HOME for the
    # layout. If GEM_HOME or BUNDLE_PATH is overridden in the environment,
    # merge an additional policy covering those paths.
    #
    # ## Excluded layouts
    #
    # macOS system Ruby (/usr/bin/ruby) is excluded — its lib paths depend on
    # whichever Xcode/CLT toolchain is active and are not statically knowable.
    # It is also deprecated for developer use by Apple.
    #
    # The ~/.linuxbrew fallback for Linuxbrew is excluded — it is a
    # runtime-dependent path that cannot be known at preset-definition time.
