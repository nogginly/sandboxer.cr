    # Homebrew uses different root directories depending on platform and
    # architecture. Merge the appropriate constant into your policy before
    # running a brew-installed command:
    #
    #   policy = my_policy.merge(Sandboxer::Preset::Brew::MACOS_ARM)
    #
    # All paths are granted read-only access. If a brew-installed tool needs
    # to write under its prefix (uncommon), add the path to your own policy's
    # read_write_paths.

      # here for completeness.
