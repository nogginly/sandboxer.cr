    # Pre-defined policies for common Python installations.
    #
    # Choose the constant that matches the Python installation layout, or use
    # `for_executable` / `for_venv` to derive a policy at runtime — useful
    # for manager-installed interpreters and virtual environments, where the
    # paths involved are not statically knowable.
    #
    # ## Static presets
    #
    # Each constant covers the Python runtime and stdlib for a known, fixed
    # installation layout. Merge the appropriate constant into your policy:
    #
    #   policy = my_policy.merge(Sandboxer::Preset::Python::MACOS_ARM_BREW)
    #
    # ## for_executable
    #
    # For interpreters installed by a version manager (pyenv, `uv python
    # install`), where the install root varies at runtime:
    #
    #   policy = my_policy.merge(Sandboxer::Preset::Python.for_executable("/path/to/python3"))
    #
    # The path must be the real binary, not a shim. For shim-based managers:
    #
    #   # pyenv
    #   python_path = `pyenv which python`.chomp
    #
    # `uv`-managed interpreters are not shimmed (uv installs real binaries
    # under its data directory), so `which python` resolves directly when a
    # uv-managed interpreter is first on PATH.
    #
    # ## for_venv
    #
    # A virtual environment is a thin directory that points back at a base
    # interpreter rather than containing a full one — `uv venv` and
    # `python -m venv` both create one in this shape, conventionally at
    # `.venv` next to the project's `pyproject.toml`. `for_venv` reads the
    # venv's `pyvenv.cfg` (specifically its `executable` / `base-executable`
    # key) to find the base interpreter, and grants access to both the
    # venv's own site-packages and the base interpreter's tree:
    #
    #   policy = my_policy.merge(Sandboxer::Preset::Python.for_venv("/path/to/project/.venv"))
    #
    # This is read-only — it covers running a script against an already
    # resolved environment, not `pip install` / `uv add` (which need write
    # access to the venv and, typically, network access).
    #
    # ## Excluded layouts
    #
    # macOS system Python (/usr/bin/python3) is excluded — Apple ships it
    # without a stable, documented lib path guarantee across OS versions,
    # and Apple discourages relying on it for development.
    #
    # The ~/.linuxbrew fallback for Linuxbrew is excluded — it is a
    # runtime-dependent path that cannot be known at preset-definition time.
    #
    # uv's own cache and tool-install directories are out of scope — they
    # are needed by `uv` itself during install/sync, not by the interpreter
    # at runtime, the same way `gem install` is out of scope for the Ruby
    # presets.
